Rewrite the orc animation program so that it uses the MVC design pattern. Be certain that your view does not directly change the model, and the model does not directly change the view. All of the state of the "game" should stay in the model; anyone looking at the model should know all information about the state of the world. Use the files provided to start your design. You may work individually or in pairs.

You need to commit your solution to a GitHub repository. Please use [this](https://classroom.github.com/g/w0xy-Gio) link to join the assignment repository. (Note: You may work alone or in pairs, so the repository can have only two members at most. **If you are working in pairs, just one of you should create a team and invite the other person to join.**)
