Lab 8
===

Go through the tutorial at [link](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/) to understand "Pull Requests" in GitHub, and pay attention to how it can help your team collaborate during your project.

For this lab, you need to add actions to your orc animation using keypresses. You should incorporate at least two actions using keypress events. For example, if the user presses 'F' on the keyboard, your orc should 'fire', and pressing 'J' should make it jump.

Also, instead of button to change directions (as in last lab), use up, down, right, and left arrow keys to make the orc move in the respective directions (No need to include diagonal movements such as "northeast" at this time).

You can build upon the same code from the last lab, but make sure to use "Pull Requests" when you finalize and merge each new functionality with the master.
